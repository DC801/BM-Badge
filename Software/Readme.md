# DC801 Badge Software

We hope you enjoyed the badge this year.  We're including the same BLE broadcast software that we've used on the DC27PartyBadge so you can still interact with the other defcon badges.

Here are some of this year's badge features:

 - A Custom Game with its own engine that can load new scenarios from an SD card.
 - Awesome gameplay involving live hacking of the RAM in the running game scenario.
 - Tons of awesome, custom artwork.
 - BLE broadcasts
