I have _no idea_ what I'm going.

## Entities

May have a Sprite

Sprites have
- image: path to image file, relative to `scenario_source_files`,
- imageWidth: uint16_t,
- imageHeight: uint16_t,
- spriteWidth: uint16_t,
- spriteHeight: uint16_t,
- **orientationAxis**: 0 if your image holds directions along the X axis, 1 if it holds directions along the Y axis
- **frameAxis**: 1 if your image holds animation frames along the Y axis, 0 if it holds animation frames along the X axis,
- **orientations**: An array of all directions supported in this image.
    - Orientation array items 0 - 3 are expressed clockwise.
        - index 0: ↑
        - index 1: →
        - index 2: ↓
        - index 3: ←
    - The VALUE AT a particular INDEX holds the orientationAxis offset from which to read that orientation's frames
    - If your artwork is pointing `↑→↓←`, your array would be: [0,1,2,3]
    - If your artwork is pointing `←↓↑→`, your array would be: [2,3,1,0]
    - If you download an image from the internet and the artwork is pointing `↑↗→↘↓↙←↖`, some of those directions are unsupported in our engine(`↗↘↙↖`), your array would be: [0,2,4,6]
    - If your artwork only supports `↓`, your array would be: [0,0,0,0]
        - no artwork for ↑ orientation, fall back to orientationAxis offset 0
        - no artwork for → orientation, fall back to orientationAxis offset 0
        - YES artwork for ↓ orientation, read from orientationAxis offset 0
        - no artwork for ← orientation, fall back to orientationAxis offset 0
