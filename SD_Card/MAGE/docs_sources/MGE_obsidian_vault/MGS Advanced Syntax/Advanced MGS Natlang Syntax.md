# Advanced MGS Natlang Syntax

These features are QOL expansions and substitutions that allow [[MGS Natlang]] to more closely resemble real programming languages.

None of these features exist in the "real" underlying MGE structure (JSON); if using the JSON to Natlang converter, none of these will be present.
