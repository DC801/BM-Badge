# Quoted String

One of the [[Variables (MGS)|MGS Natlang variable]] types.

These can be just about anything as long as it's wrapped in a matching pair of double quotes (`"`) or single quotes (`'`). (It's JavaScript under the hood. Be kind!)

Quotes and certain other characters must be escaped (`\"`) inside a quoted string.

Quoted strings satisfy the requirement for anything that calls for a [[string]].
