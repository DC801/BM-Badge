# Terminal

The terminal interface, new in the chapter 2 version of the Mage Game Engine (MGE), allows a computer to connect to the badge over USB and use it as a serial host.

Some serial commands are build in to the MGE by default, but others must be [[REGISTER_SERIAL_COMMAND|registered]].

[[Scripts]] can print serial messages with [[serial dialogs]], and these can listen for specific serial input, too, with [[serial dialog options]].
