# Web Build

The web build of the DC801 black mage allows you to drag and drop a `game.dat` into your browser window to play test (or play!) any Mage Game Engine (MGE) scenario.

As of November 2023, the latest build for chapter 2 is available here: https://admiralpotato.github.io/secret_black_mage_badge_mirror/
