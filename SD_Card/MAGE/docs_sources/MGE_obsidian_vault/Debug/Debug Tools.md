# Debug Tools

There are several debug modes available to a game while it's running:

- [[Vector view]] — see the [[vector objects]] you're using on the [[maps|map]]
- [[Debug mode]] — enable addition [[entities]], logging, or other [[scripts|scripting]] behavior
- [[Hex editor]] — hey, don't forget the game has a built-in hex editor!

A few tools for the web:

- [[MGE encoder console]] — output printed by the [[web encoder]] or the [[CLI encoder]]
- [[Inspecting with the Web Encoder]] — inspect via JavaScript console the WIP data the [[web encoder]] is collecting and processing
- [[Kaitai]] — a binary data analysis tool (free)
