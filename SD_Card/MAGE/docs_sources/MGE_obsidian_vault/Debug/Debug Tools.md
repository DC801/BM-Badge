# Debug Tools

There are several debug modes available to a game while it's running:

- [[Vector View]] — see the vector objects you're using on the map
- [[Debug Mode]] — enable addition entities, logging, or other scripting behavior

And a few tools for the web:

- [[MGE Encoder Console]] — output printed by the [[Web Encoder]] or the [[CLI Encoder]]
- [[Inspecting with the Web Encoder]] — inspect via JavaScript console the WIP data the [[Web Encoder]] is collecting and processing 
- [[Kaitai]] — a binary data analysis tool (free)
