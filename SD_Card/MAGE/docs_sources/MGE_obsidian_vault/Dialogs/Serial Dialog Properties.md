# Serial Dialog Properties

See: [[Serial Dialogs (JSON)]], [[Serial Dialogs (MGS)]]

The only required [[serial dialogs|serial dialog]] property is `messages`, though there are [[Serial Dialog Options (JSON)|two optional types of options]]: multiple choice or free response.

Serial dialogs are not wrapped by default (unless handled by [[MGS Natlang]]).
