# %PLAYER%

One of the [[relative entity references]].

When used as the target of an action, `%PLAYER%` refers to the player entity (the entity marked `is_player` on the map in Tiled).

When used in the body of a message (e.g. `"Hello, %PLAYER%!"`) it will use the [[Printing Current Values|current name]] of the player entity.
