# Debug Tools

There are several debug modes available to a game while it's running:

- [Vector view](debug/vector_view) — see the [vector objects](maps/vector_objects) you're using on the [map](maps)
- [Debug mode](debug/debug_mode) — enable addition [entities](entities), logging, or other [scripting](scripts) behavior
- [Hex editor](hardware/hex_editor) — hey, don't forget the game has a built-in hex editor!

A few tools for the web:

- [MGE encoder console](debug/mge_encoder_console) — output printed by the [web encoder](encoder/web_encoder) or the [CLI encoder](encoder/cli_encoder)
- [Inspecting with the web encoder](debug/inspecting_with_the_web_encoder) — inspect via JavaScript console the WIP data the [web encoder](encoder/web_encoder) is collecting and processing
- [Kaitai](Kaitai) — a binary data analysis tool (free)
