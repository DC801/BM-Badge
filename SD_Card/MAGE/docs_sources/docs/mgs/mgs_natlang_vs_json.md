# MGS Natlang vs JSON

#updateme 

### Original script JSON

```json
{
  "on_tick-greenhouse": [
    {
      "action": "CHECK_IF_ENTITY_IS_IN_GEOMETRY",
      "entity": "%PLAYER%",
      "geometry": "door-greenhouse",
      "success_script": "leave-greenhouse",
      "expected_bool": true
    },
    {
      "action": "COPY_SCRIPT",
      "script": "ethernettle-uproot-check",
      "comment": "some kind of comment"
    }
  ]
}
```

While relatively human readable, the above is difficult to write in practice.

- It's bulky enough that you can't have very much scripting logic on your screen at once.
- It's easy to lose track of what you're doing as you must constantly reference named scripts and dialogs (and serial dialogs) in different files back and forth.
- JSON cannot be commented, so it's inconvenient to leave yourself supplementary information, such as the contents of a dialog you're referencing when scripting a cutscene.
- The parameters for MGE actions are not uniform, so it's easy to forget or confuse parameters if you're not copying and pasting actions from nearby.

### MGS Natlang (script)

```mgs
on_tick-greenhouse {
  if entity "%PLAYER%" is inside geometry door-greenhouse
    then goto leave-greenhouse;
  copy script ethernettle-uproot-check;
  // some kind of comment
}
```

This is far more approachable â€” more compact, and the nested relationship of the script and its actions is far easier to see at a glance. Human-friendly grammar constructions (e.g. `is inside` vs `is not inside`) makes it much easier to follow script branching logic.

### Original dialog JSON

```json
{
  "exampleDialogName": [
    {
      "alignment": "BOTTOM_LEFT",
      "entity": "Trekkie",
      "messages": [
        "Me want to wish you a happy birthday,\n%PLAYER%."
      ]
    },
    {
      "alignment": "BOTTOM_RIGHT",
      "entity": "%PLAYER%",
      "messages": [
        "Aww, gee, thanks, Farmer\n%Trekkie%!"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Dialog JSON is more uniform than script JSON is, but its information density is even worse.

### MGS Natlang (dialog)

```mgs
settings for dialog {
  default { alignment BL }
  label PLAYER { entity "%PLAYER%" alignment BR }
}
```

With MGS Natlang, you can create presets for common dialog settings (see above), after which, the dialogs themselves become very lightweight:

```mgs
dialog exampleDialogName {
  Trekkie "Me want to wish you a happy birthday, %PLAYER%."
  PLAYER "Aww, gee, thanks, Farmer %Trekkie%!"
}
```

```mgs
dialog exampleDialog2 {
  PLAYER
  "Neat."
}

// is equivalent to

dialog exampleDialog2 { PLAYER "Neat." }
```

### MGS Natlang (combined)

However, where MGS Natlang really shines is in combining both script data and dialog data together:

```mgs
settings for dialog {
  label PLAYER { entity "%PLAYER%" alignment BR }
}
cutscene {
  turn player control off;
  walk entity "%PLAYER%" along geometry approach-desk over 600ms;
  wait 800ms;
  turn entity Trekkie toward entity "%PLAYER%";
  wait 200ms;
  show dialog {
    Trekkie "Oh, welcome, %PLAYER%!"
  }
}
```

Now the dialog's content is no longer separated from its context. The dialog no longer needs a name, either, unless another script needs to refer to it, too.
