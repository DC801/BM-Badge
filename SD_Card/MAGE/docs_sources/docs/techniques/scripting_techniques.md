# Scripting Techniques

These are some of the techniques we developed when making the BMG2020. The game itself may not follow these patterns perfectly (since they weren't all invented yet) but game developers might want to at least keep these techniques in mind.

- [COPY_SCRIPT Uses](../techniques/copy_script_uses) (general)
- [Doors](../techniques/doors) (general)
- [Coordinate Considerations](../techniques/coordinate_considerations) (puzzle design)
- [Hint Systems](../techniques/hint_systems) (puzzle design)
- [Spawn Points](../techniques/spawn_points) (entity behavior)
- [One Script, Multiple Behaviors](../techniques/one_script_multiple_behaviors) (entity behavior)
- [Handlers](../techniques/handlers) (entity behavior)
- [Actors](../techniques/actors) (entity behavior)
- [Cutscenes](../techniques/cutscenes) (cinematics)

Deprecated:

- [Beginnings, Middles, and Ends](../techniques/beginnings_middles_and_ends) (largely unnecessary due to `if`/`else` and in-script `goto`)
- [Chains of Small Checks](../techniques/chains_of_small_checks) (deprecated; `if`/`else` makes such behavior possible to implement the normal way)
- [Grand Finale (Beatrice)](grand_finale_beatrice)(largely unnecessary due to existence of [MGS Natlang](../mgs/mgs_natlang))
