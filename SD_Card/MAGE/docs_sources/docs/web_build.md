# Web Build

The web build of the Mage Game Engine (MGE) allows you to drag and drop a `game.dat` into your browser window to play test (or play!) any MGE scenario.

As of November 2023, the latest build for chapter 2 is available here: https://admiralpotato.github.io/secret_black_mage_badge_mirror/
