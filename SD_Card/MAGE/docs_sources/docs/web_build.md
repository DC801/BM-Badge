# Web Build

The web build of the Mage Game Engine (MGE) allows you to drag and drop a `game.dat` into your browser window to play test (or play!) any MGE scenario.

As of mid 2024, the latest build for chapter 2 engine is available here: [https://admiralpotato.github.io/secret_black_mage_badge_mirror/](https://admiralpotato.github.io/secret_black_mage_badge_mirror/). This may not include the latest `game.dat`, however, so download it from the Black Mage Game repo (or clone it locally) and drag it into the game window.

Save game data persists per `game.dat` file.
