# Serial Dialog Properties

See: [Serial Dialogs (JSON)](../dialogs/serial_dialogs_json), [Serial Dialogs (MGS)](../mgs/serial_dialogs_mgs)

The only required [serial dialog](../dialogs/serial_dialogs) property is `messages`, though there are [two optional types of options](../dialogs/serial_dialog_options_json): multiple choice or free response.

Serial dialogs are not wrapped by default (unless handled by [MGS Natlang](../mgs/mgs_natlang)).
