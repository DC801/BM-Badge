# Serial Dialogs

**Serial dialogs** are a means to print messages on the serial [terminal](../hardware/terminal) (new as of the chapter 2+ version of the MGE).

They need not function as [character](../entities) [dialog](../dialogs), strictly speaking; they can be anything, including debug messages, ASCII maps, room or character descriptions, etc.

## Structure

These are much more simple than ordinary [dialogs](../dialogs), but the JSON structure and the MGS Natlang structure is different:

- [Serial Dialogs (JSON)](../dialogs/serial_dialogs_json)
- [Serial Dialogs (MGS)](../mgs/serial_dialogs_mgs)
