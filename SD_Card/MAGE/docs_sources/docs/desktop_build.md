# Desktop Build

The desktop build of the game is limited to Linux at the moment.

You can pull the repo and try to build it yourself, but note that we have prepared a [Linux VM](mge_vm) for your convenience (though it may be out of date).

::: tip Use the web build!
It is our strong recommendation that you use the [web build](web_build) for game testing (and playing) purposes. This is much easier to use!
