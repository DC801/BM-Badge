# `null_script`

The only built-in [script](../scripts) in the Mage Game Engine. This script contains no actions.

A script can set any normal [script slot](../scripts/script_slots) to `null_script` with any of the normal script-controlling actions, and can change itself to `null_script` by using [RUN_SCRIPT](../actions/RUN_SCRIPT).
