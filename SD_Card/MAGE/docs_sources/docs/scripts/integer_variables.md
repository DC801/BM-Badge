# Integer Variables

Also see: [Variable Types](scripts/variable_types)

Integer variables are technically `uint16_t`, meaning they can be any whole number between `0` and `65535`. (NOTE: no negative numbers.)

The default value for these is `0`.

You may have up to 255 of these. You need not declare them before you use them; simply using them will allow the encoder to initialize them.
