## Brainstorming ##
**puns**
* "We all make mistakes but you just need to solder on"
* "I hate talking to ___ They always give me the cold solder."
* "go flux yourself."
* "Have you tried turning it off and turning it back on again?"
* "Hey you found a mouse, don't let it byte you"
* Favorite singer: "A Dell"
* Band name: 1023 megabytes, (they havent had a gig yet)
* gold phish (evil Mr. Tickles)
* characters who have been "poped off the stack"
* Refer to things as "fragmented" (maybe in filesystem dungeon)
* symlink pun (maybe they lost the symlinks for the doors?)
* BIOS
* TPM 2.0
* CMOS (seamoss) battery
* Weird Intel code names for sockets and such
* Its always DNS
* "If you don't think its DNS, its probably DNS."

**Ideas**
* Collect cpu cores in the dungeon
* SATA something something fire.
* Castle north bridge and south bridge
* Time is a problem
