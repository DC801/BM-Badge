/*
on Windows 10:
open Device Manager
Click Ports (COM & LPT)
If Ports isn't there, turn on "Show Hidden Devices" in the View menu
A serial device should show up; look for a COM port with an icon that isn't paled out (e.g. COM4)
	-> If there isn't a non-pale icon, it's not plugged in right or there's something wrong with the port on the badge
	-> TIP: try flipping the USB-C cable around, or trying another port on your computer
Open the application called `PuTTY` (Windows doesn't come with this; install it somehow)
Set `Connection type` to Serial
`Serial line` should be whatever the device was
`Speed` should be 115200 baud
	-> TIP: you can save these settings as a preset [how to do it?]
Click `OPEN`
If you see a serial "welcome" type message, it worked

on some kind of Linux
go to /dev/ and find something called ttyACM0
use picocom (you might have to install it)
add yourself to the serial so you're not running picocom as sudo `sudo adduser ~ dialout`

Linux Mint(Ubuntu based):
sudo apt install picocom
ls /dev/serial/by-id/
^ read the list of devices that come out of here
picocom /dev/serial/by-id/(ONE OF THE DEVICES FROM THE LIST ABOVE)
