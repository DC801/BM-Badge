## Overview

MGS Natlang is a "natural" language meant to be easy to read and write.

It consists of phrases and patterns that correspond closely to the JSON required by the MGE encoder. Strictly speaking, it is not a full, properly recursive language, but it is much more flexible and compact than writing the equivalent script actions and dialogs in MGE JSON.

All .mgs files are turned into MGE JSON automatically by the MGE encoder. And unlike script files and dialog files, you don't need to declare .mgs files in the game's `scenario.json`; any .mgs files inside `scenario_source_files` will be imported.

### Syntax Features

1. White space agnostic.
	- The syntax coloring might break if you are very creative with line breaks, but it should still parse correctly.
2. Many strings can be unquoted or quoted freely.
	- Double or single quotes are both fine.
	- Anything with a space or any unusual character *must* be wrapped in quotes.
3. Many words are optional, and can be included either to increase logical clarity or omitted to decrease word density. E.g. the following two patterns are equivalent phrases:
	- `goto script scriptName`
	- `goto scriptName`
4. Certain [MGE variables](#variable-types-and-examples) can be formatted in multiple, human-friendly ways, e.g.
	- Duration: `1000ms` or `1s` or `1000`
	- Quantity: `once` or `1x` or `1`

### Syntax Colors

A syntax coloring grammar (tmLanguage) is in development: https://github.com/alamedyang/magegamescript-syntax-highlighting

#### Visual Studio Code

When you open an .mgs file, VSCode will offer marketplace extensions for it. Alternatively, search for "MageGameScript Colors" in the Visual Studio Code extensions marketplace.

After installing the extension, all .mgs files you open will have syntax coloring.

VSCode will update the extension automatically whenever a new version comes out.

#### Sublime Text

Visit the syntax colors repo above (or clone it locally), then find the `mgs.tmLanguage` file in the `syntaxes` folder. Move this file to wherever Sublime Text wants its coloring grammars in your operating system. After this, you can select MageGameScript under View > Syntax to style the text in your .mgs files.

You will have to update the `mgs.tmLanguage` manually by repeating the above process when a new version is released.

#### Other IDEs

Many other IDEs will accept TextMate grammars, but you will have to find and follow your IDE's specific instructions.

## MGS Natlang vs JSON

### Original script JSON

```json
{
  "on_tick-greenhouse": [
    {
      "action": "CHECK_IF_ENTITY_IS_IN_GEOMETRY",
      "entity": "%PLAYER%",
      "geometry": "door-greenhouse",
      "success_script": "leave-greenhouse",
      "expected_bool": true
    },
    {
      "action": "COPY_SCRIPT",
      "script": "ethernettle-uproot-check",
      "comment": "some kind of comment"
    }
  ]
}
```

While relatively human readable, the above is difficult to write in practice.

- It's bulky enough that you can't have very much scripting logic on your screen at once.
- It's easy to lose track of what you're doing as you must constantly reference named scripts and dialogs (and serial dialogs) in different files back and forth.
- JSON cannot be commented, so it's inconvenient to leave yourself supplementary information, such as the contents of a dialog you're referencing when scripting a cutscene.
- The parameters for MGE actions are not highly uniform, so it's easy to forget or confuse parameters if you're not copying and pasting actions from nearby.

### MGS Natlang (script)

```
on_tick-greenhouse {
  if entity "%PLAYER%" is inside geometry door-greenhouse
    then goto leave-greenhouse
  copy script ethernettle-uproot-check // some kind of comment
}
```

Apart from the fact that the MGS Natlang won't receive any syntax coloring by default, this is more approachable.

It's more compact, and the nested relationship of the script and its actions is far easier to see at a glance. Human-friendly grammar constructions (e.g. `is inside` vs `is not inside`) makes it much easier to follow script branching logic.

### Original dialog JSON

```json
{
  "exampleDialogName": [
    {
      "alignment": "BOTTOM_LEFT",
      "entity": "Trekkie",
      "messages": [
        "Me want to wish you a happy birthday,\n%PLAYER%."
      ]
    },
    {
      "alignment": "BOTTOM_RIGHT",
      "entity": "%PLAYER%",
      "messages": [
        "Aww, gee, thanks, Farmer\n%Trekkie%!"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Dialog JSON is more uniform than script JSON is, but its information density is even worse.

### MGS Natlang (dialog)

```
settings for dialog {
  defaults {
    alignment BL
  }
  parameters for label PLAYER {
    entity "%PLAYER%"
    alignment BR
  }
}
```

With MGS Natlang, you can create presets for common dialog settings. As a result, the dialogs themselves can be very lightweight, making it effortless to read and write large swaths of them:

```
dialog exampleDialogName {
  Trekkie
  "Me want to wish you a happy birthday, %PLAYER%."

  PLAYER
  "Aww, gee, thanks, Farmer %Trekkie%!"
}
```

And since MGS Natlang is white space agnostic, it can become as compact as you want:

```
dialog exampleDialog2 {
  PLAYER "Neat."
}
```

or even

```
dialog exampleDialog2 { PLAYER "Neat." }
```

### MGS Natlang (combined)

However, where MGS Natlang really shines is in combining both script data and dialog data together:

```
settings for dialog {
  parameters for label PLAYER {
    entity "%PLAYER%"
    alignment BR
  }
}
show_dialog-wopr-backdoor {
  set player control to off
  walk entity "%PLAYER%" along geometry wopr-walkin over 600ms
  wait 400ms
  set player control to on
  show dialog {
    PLAYER
    "Whoa! It looks like I found some kind of back door."
  }
  set flag backdoor-found to true
}
```

Now the dialog's content is no longer separated from its context. The dialog no longer needs a name, either, unless another script needs to refer to it, too.

## Block structure

MGS Natlang currently has several types of blocks, each with their block contents enclosed in a pair of matching curly braces:

```
<BLOCK DECLARATION> { <BLOCK BODY> }

// or

<BLOCK DECLARATION> {
  <BLOCK BODY>
}

// etc
```

Some block types can (or must) be nested within others, but blocks cannot be nested arbitrarily.

### Block quick reference

Unless otherwise marked, assume all entries in the following list are allowed in any quantity (including zero). Numbered items must be given in exactly that order, but all other items can occur in any order within their parent block.

- **[dialog settings block](#dialog-settings-block)**
	- **[dialog settings target block](#dialog-settings-target-block)**
		- **[dialog parameter](#dialog-parameters)**
- **[dialog block](#dialog-block)**
	- **[dialog](#dialog)**
		1. **[dialog identifier](#dialog-identifier)** (exactly 1)
		2. **[dialog parameter](#dialog-parameters)**
		3. **[dialog message](#dialog-message)** (at least 1)
		4. **[dialog option](#dialog-option)**
- **[script block](#script-block)**
	- **[action](#actions)**
	- **[show dialog block](#show-dialog-block)**
		- **[dialog](#dialog)**
			1. **[dialog identifier](#dialog-identifier)** (exactly 1)
			2. **[dialog parameter](#dialog-parameters)**
			3. **[dialog message](#dialog-message)** (at least 1)
			4. **[dialog option](#dialog-option)**

### Syntax definitions

In all syntax definitions in this document, words in parentheses are optional, and words starting with dollar signs are [MGS Natlang variables](#mgs-natlang-variables).

### Dialog settings block

```
settings (for) dialog {}
```

These are a means of defining dialog parameters ahead of time so the dialogs themselves can be very lean.

These blocks must occur on the root level.

**Block contents**: any number of [dialog settings target blocks](#dialog-settings-target-block) in any order.

#### Behavior

Dialog settings are applied to dialogs in order as the parser encounters them; a dialog settings block partway down the file will affect only the dialogs afterward, and none before.

- **New settings will override old settings.**
	- E.g. if you assign the player the alignment `TOP_RIGHT` and then `BOTTOM_RIGHT` back-to-back, dialogs will use `BOTTOM_RIGHT`.
- **Entity settings will override global settings.**
	- E.g. if you assign alignment `BOTTOM_LEFT` to the global defaults, and `BOTTOM_RIGHT` to the player entity, dialogs involving the player entity will use `BOTTOM_RIGHT`.
- **Label settings will override entity settings.**
- Parameters given in a dialog's body will override any other settings, however.

### Dialog settings target block

```
(parameters) (for) <TARGET> {}
```

Several choices for `TARGET`:

- `(global) default(s)`
	- Describes the default behavior for all dialogs in the same MGS Natlang file.
	- Of all MGE dialog parameters, only `alignment` is 100% required, so this is a good parameter to include at the global level.
- `entity $string`
	- Describes the default dialog settings for a specific entity.
- `label $bareword`
	- Defines a dialog identifier shortcut or alias to a specific set of settings.
	- The label name *must* be a [bareword](#bareword), not a [quoted string](#quoted-string).
	- Dialog labels only exist in MGS Natlang (not the MGE itself), so they do not apply to other entity references (such as the target of an action).

These blocks occur within [dialog settings blocks](#dialog-settings-block).

**Block contents**: any number of [dialog parameters](#dialog-parameters) in any order.

#### Example

```
parameters for label PLAYER {
  entity "%PLAYER%"
  alignment BR
}
```

This is a common use case for dialog settings, after which you can use `PLAYER` instead of `entity "%PLAYER%"` as a [dialog identifier](#dialog-identifier) for [dialogs](#dialog).

### Dialog block

```
dialog $string {}
```

Dialog blocks allow you to name and populate a game dialog.

As these dialog blocks don't have any baked-in script context, a dialog name is required. (The name is whatever is given for [string](#string).)

These blocks must occur on the root level.

[Show dialog blocks](#show-dialog-block) are similar, except that the latter is used inside a [script block](#script-block) and is not required to have a dialog name.

**Block contents**: any number of [dialogs](#dialogs) in the order they are to be seen in-game.

### Script block

```
(script) $string {}
```

If the word `script` is absent, any [string](#string) (other than `dialog`, `settings` etc.) will be intepreted as the script name.

These blocks must occur on the root level.

**Block contents**: any number of [actions](#actions) in the order they are to be executed in-game. Some of these may be [show dialog blocks](#show-dialog-block). (See the [action dictionary](#action-dictionary) far below for detailed information on each action.)

### Show dialog block

```
show dialog ($string) {}
```

This block combines a dialog definition with the [`SHOW_DIALOG`](#show_dialog) action (as opposed to a [dialog block](#dialog-block), which is a dialog definition alone.)

The dialog name ([string](#string)) is optional. Internally, the JSON still requires a dialog name, but if absent, the MGS Natlang translator generates one based on the file name and line number. For authors writing content in MGS Natlang exclusively, this will be entirely invisible. Omitting dialog names for one-offs is recommended to keep things clean.

Must be used inside a [script block](#script-block).

**Block contents**: Any number of [dialogs](#dialog) in the order they are to be seen in-game.

#### `SHOW_DIALOG`

A related construction:

```
show dialog $string
```

This plain `SHOW_DIALOG` action can "call" a dialog without having to define it in place.

Dialogs being called this way may be defined elsewhere in the file (even further down) or in another file entirely. The MGE encoder, which sees all scripts and all dialogs at the same time, will warn you if you're calling a dialog that doesn't exist.

### Show serial dialog block

Serial dialog blocks will behave similarly to dialog blocks. (They are not yet implemented in MGS Natlang.)

### Dialog

Found within [dialog blocks](#dialog-block) or [show dialog blocks](#show-dialog-block).

Any number of dialogs can be given back-to-back within their parent block.

#### Dialog contents

1. [Dialog identifier](#dialog-identifier): exactly 1
2. [Dialog parameter](#dialog-parameter): 0+
3. [Dialog message](#dialog-message): 1+
4. [Dialog option](#dialog-option): 0-4x

#### Dialog identifier:

This identifies the "speaker" of the dialog messages that immediately follow. For most cases, this will be a specific entity (with option #1 or #2), though you could also build up a dialog from its component pieces instead (with option #3).

The three options:

1. `$bareword`
	- The bareword identifier refers to a dialog label within a [dialog settings target block](#dialog-settings-target-block).
		- If no dialog label is found, the bareword value is assumed to be an entity name instead. This usage also provides the entity name as an `entity` [parameter](#dialog-parameter) for the dialog.
		- Entity names with spaces or other special characters are not eligible for this usage, however.
	- NOTE: A [quoted string](#quoted-string) is NOT allowed here! This string *must* be a [bareword](#bareword)!
2. `entity $string`
	- [string](#string): an entity's given name (i.e. the entity's name within the Tiled map).
	- This usage also provides the entity name as an `entity` [parameter](#dialog-parameter) for the dialog.
	- `%PLAYER%` and `%SELF%` must use this pattern (and not the [bareword](#bareword) pattern) because they contain special characters. As this can be cumbersome, it's probably best to set up a dialog settings label for them so you can use a bareword as an identifier instead.
3. `name $string`
	- [string](#string): the dialog's display name.
	- This usage also provides a `name` [parameter](#dialog-parameter) for the dialog.

#### Dialog parameter:

Multiple dialog parameters can occur back-to-back.

Syntax for each parameter:

- `entity $string`
	- [String](#string): the "given name" of the entity (i.e. the entity's name on the Tiled map). (Wrapping this name in `%`s is entirely unnecessary and will in fact confuse the MGE encoder.)
		- Can be `%PLAYER%` or `%SELF%`, however.
	- A dialog can inherit a `name` and a `portrait` if given an `entity` parameter. (The entity must be a "character entity" for a portrait to be inherited.)
	- The inherited `name` is a relative reference; the dialog display name will be whatever that entity's name is at that moment.
- `name $string`
	- [String](#string): a fixed string of no more than 12 ASCII characters. For a relative name instead, wrap a specific entity's name in `%`s.
		- Can be `%PLAYER%` or `%SELF%`.
	- Overrides names inherited via the `entity` parameter.
	- A dialog name is required, either via this parameter or the `entity` parameter.
- `portrait $string`
	- [String](#string): the name of a MGE portrait.
	- Overrides portraits inherited via the `entity` parameter.
- `alignment $string`
	- [String](#string): one of the following:
		- `TR` (or `TOP_RIGHT`)
		- `BR` (or `BOTTOM_RIGHT`)
		- `TL` (or `TOP_LEFT`)
		- `BL` (or `BOTTOM_LEFT`) (default)
- `border_tileset $string`
	- [String](#string): the name of a MGE tileset.
	- The default tileset is used if none is provided.
- `emote $number`
	- [Number](#number): the id of the "emote" in that entity's entry in `portraits.json`.
	- The default emote (`0`) will display if not specified.
- `wrap messages (to) $number`
	- [Number](#number): the number of chars to auto wrap the contents of dialog messages.
	- 42 is default.

#### Dialog message:

Any [quoted string](#quoted-string).

- Each message is a new "text screen" in the game.
- Only ASCII characters will be printed.
- Insert an entity's current name (aka "relative name") by wrapping their given name in `%`s.
	- `%PLAYER%` and `%SELF%` are also allowed, which target the player entity or the entity that is running the script, respectively.
	- Words wrapped in `%`s will count as 12 chars when the dialog message is auto-wrapped.
- Insert the current value of a MGE variable by wrapping its name in `$`s.
	- Words wrapped in `$`s will count as 5 chars when the dialog message is auto-wrapped.
- Some characters must be escaped in the message body, such as double quote: `\"`
	- `\t` (tabs) are auto-converted to four spaces.
	- `\n` (new lines) are honored, but since text is wrapped automatically, don't worry about explicitly hard wrapping your messages unless you want to put line breaks in arbitrary places.
	- `%` and `$` are printable characters unless used in pairs within a single line, in which case the only way to print them is to escape them (e.g. `\%`).
- Word processor "smart" characters such as ellipses (â€¦) or emdashes (â€”) are auto converted to ASCII equivalents (`...`) (`--`).

#### Dialog option

```
> $label:quotedString : (goto) (script) $script:string
```

- You may have up to 4 dialog options per dialog.
- As each of these "branches" results in a script `goto`, no dialog messages afterward will be seen. Therefore, any dialog options must come last within the dialog.
- The **label** is what will be shown to the player. As the cursor (approximated with `>`) takes up some room, assume you will only have 39 characters instead of the usual 42.
	- The label behaves like dialog messages in terms of inserting variables (with `$` or `%`), escaped characters, etc.
	- **Must** be wrapped in [quotes](#quoted-string).
- In the MGE, dialog options are displayed underneath the final dialog message. Therefore, the last dialog message before any options should consist of a single line of no more than 42 characters.
- The words `goto` and `script` are optional. Any [string](#string) given after the `:` (other than `goto` and `script`) is assumed to be the script name.

#### Example dialogs

Bringing this all together in an example [dialog block](#dialog-block):

```
dialog exampleDialog {
  Bob
  "So I heard about this club...."

  Bob
  alignment BR
  "Oh, no. Don't you start."

  Bob
  "No, no, I swear! Hear me out!"
  > "Fine. What club?"
    : goto bobContinueScript
  > "(walk away)"
    : goto bobLeaveScript
  > "(smack %Bob% with a rubber chicken)"
    : goto bobNoveltyScript
}
```

Note: white space doesn't matter, so the first option above could very well have been written this way:

```
> "Fine. What club?" : goto bobContinueScript
```

### Comments

MGS Natlang supports two kinds of comments, which can appear anywhere in an .mgs file and inside any block.

#### Inline comment

```
testScript {
  wait 1000ms
  wait 1000ms // inline comment
}
```

This is the only time that line breaks are syntactic in MGS Natlang â€”Â inline comments start with `//` and end either with a line break or the end of the document.

Fun fact: the MGS Natlang translator (JSON -> Natlang) will take extraneous properties from actions and the like and turn them into inline comments automatically.

#### Block comment

```
/*
Block comment:
Everything inside is a comment!
The lexer ignores it all! WHEEE
*/
```

Anything between a `/*` and a `*/` is part of the block comment, allowing you to put line breaks and/or extensive text inside a comment.

## MGS Natlang variables

In this document's example syntax, variables are marked with `$`. Whatever is put in place of the variable in the example syntax is the variable's **value**.

For the example syntax `entity $string`:

```
entity Alice       // var value = "Alice"
entity Bob         // var value = "Bob"
entity Charlie     // var value = "Charlie"
entity "Tom Honks" // var value = "Tom Honks"
```

A variable's **value** is what populates the meat of the JSON output, but its **type** affects how each word is validated against patterns in the MGS Natlang syntax tree, and in most cases will also affect how the word may be formatted in the natlang.

This documentation uses two formats to indicate a variable, each with a `$` at the front:

- `$type`
	- e.g. `$string` (which means any valid [string](#string))
- `$label:type`
	- e.g. `$scriptName:string` (which means any valid [string](#string), and also it will be used as a script name)

The variable's label for most purposes doesn't matter much except as a hint as to the variable's purpose, especially if there are multiple variables in the natlang phrase. (It does matter when trying to analyze the JSON output, however.)

### Variable decay

A special property of variable types is "decay" â€” this means a variable of a specific type may satisfy a variable's requirement for a different type.

Example #1: an action that wants a duration (syntax `wait $duration`)

```
testScript1 {
  wait 150ms // "duration" = ok
  wait 150   // "number" is fine, too
             //   (decays to "duration")
}
```

Example #2: an action that wants a number (syntax: `load slot $number`)

```
testScript2 {
  load slot 1    // "number" = ok
  load slot 1ms  // "duration" won't work!
}
```

In most cases, human intuition is enough to predict whether a variable can decay into another type. (And most things can decay into a [bareword](#bareword), e.g. `true` and `1000ms`.)

Most important to keep in mind is that a variable wanting to be a [string](#string) will be satisfied by either a [bareword](#bareword) string or a [quoted string](#quoted-string), but barewords and quoted strings cannot be substituted for each other.

### Variable types and examples

Note that all numbers must be whole numbers and, unless indicated otherwise, must be positive.

#### Duration

Number + `ms` or `s`

- e.g. `1000ms` or `1s`
- Seconds are translated into milliseconds automatically.

#### Distance

Number + `px` or `pix`

- e.g. `32px` or `128pix`

#### Quantity

Number + `x`

- e.g. `1x` or `10x`
- The [bareword](#bareword) `once`, `twice`, and `thrice` also count as `quantity`.
- Note that the `x` comes after the number, not before.

#### Number

Number (positive or negative)

- e.g. `-1` or `100`
- While negative numbers will all validate to the `number` type, not all actions permit negative numbers.

#### Color

A CSS-style hex color.

- e.g. `#FFF` or `#00EF39`
- Some bare color names will also work, e.g. `black` or `white`.

#### Boolean

A binary option.

- True: `true`, `yes`, `on`, `open`
- False: `false`, `no`, `off`, `close`

Some actions will prefer specific pairs of booleans when being translated from JSON, but when translating the other way, any of the above words will work. E.g.

- `set player control open`
- `set player control on`
- `set player control true`

#### Operator

An exhaustive list:

- equal sign: `=`
- plus: `+`
- hyphen: `-`
	- If a `-` is directly before a number, the number will become negative. Be sure to put a space between a `-` and a number if you want the `-` to be interpreted as an operator.
- asterisk: `*`
- forward slash: `/`
- percent sign: `%`
- question mark: `?`
- curly braces: `{` and `}` (for block boundaries)
- parentheses: `(` and `)` (for macros)

Actions that call for an operator will also accept the corresponding bare words `SET`, `ADD` etc.

#### Bareword

These are limited to alphanumberic characters, plus a handful of punctuation:

- hyphen: `-`
- underscore: `_`
- period: `.`
- dollar sign: `$`
- pound: `#`
- exclamation point: `!`

Usage:

- Barewords cannot start with hyphen (`-`).
- If a bareword starts with a dollar sign (`$`), it will be interpreted as a constant by the `const!` macro.
- Barewords will count as quoted strings if wrapped in quotes, even if the bareword criteria is otherwise met.

#### Quoted string

These can be just about anything as long as it's wrapped in a matching pair of double quotes (`"`) or single quotes (`'`). (It's Javascript under the hood. Be kind!)

Quotes and certain other characters must be escaped (`\"`) inside a quoted string.

#### String

Any quoted string or [bareword](#bareword).

### General types, limited values

Some action variables will be of a generic MGS Natlang type (such as [string](#string)) but the action itself will only be satisfied by a value from a limited set of words.

In addition, some values are only valid depending on what other game data has been defined, such as entity names, map names, or script names.

In such cases, invalid values are reported by the MGE encoder.

#### Button IDS

For actions that check the button state.

NOTE: We found that the joystick clicks were aggressive on the hardware, and would trigger at what felt like arbitrary times. While the engine is capable of detecting these clicks, we recommend not using them.

- `TRIANGLE`
- `X` or `CROSS`
- `O` or `CIRCLE`
- `SQUARE`
- `HAX` (capacitive touch button on the PCB)
- `ANY`

#### Operations

Used with "mutate variable" actions.

- `=` or `SET` â€”Â sets a variable to the value given
- `+` or `ADD` â€” addition
- `-` or `SUB` â€” subtraction
- `*` or `MUL` â€” multiplication
- `/` or `DIV` â€” integer division
- `%` or `MOD` â€” modulo (remainder)
- `?` or `RNG` â€” sets a variable to a random value between 0 and the value given minus one

#### Entity animations

The int value for entity animations:

- `0` = idle animation
- `1` = walk animation
- `2` = action animation
- `3`+ = any subsequent animations the entity might have

## Macros

Macros are run after the lexer breaks the original file into tokens but before the tokens are parsed and converted into JSON.

Macros are syntax-agnostic, find-and-replace type processes, but they nonetheless offer a great deal of utility.

### Zigzag (`if` / `else`)

The pattern `if`...`then goto` is used for quite a lot of script actions, but this is verbose and clumsy because every single optional or branching script behavior has to be contained in an *entirely separate script*, as does any shared behavior that follows.

For a simple case, wherein we check a condition to determine whether to do some brief, optional behavior, we need three scripts:

```
load_map-castle-1 {
  if flag saw-castle is false then goto script load_map-castle-1a
  goto script load_map-castle-2
}

load_map-castle-1a {
  show dialog {
    PLAYER "Whoa! Look at the size of it!"
  }
  set flag saw-castle to true
  goto script load_map-castle-2
}

load_map-castle-2 {
  show dialog {
    Guard "State your name!"
  }
}
```

This gets tiresome quickly when a map's `on_load` script may need a dozen or more of these optional behaviors back-to-back, or when an entity's `on_interact` script branches three or more layers deep.

Instead, we can use an abstracted `if` / `else` syntax which this macro will expand into isolated scripts automatically.

Thanks to the zigzag macro, the above scripts could look like this instead:

```
load_map-castle {
  if (flag saw-castle is false) {
    show dialog {
        PLAYER "Whoa! Look at the size of it!"
      }
    set flag saw-castle to true
  }
  show dialog {
    Guard "State your name!"
  }
}
```

The zigzag macro will take this much-shorter script and expand it to resemble the three scripts in the first example, giving each expanded script a name derived from the original.

*Any* action with `if`...`then goto` syntax can use this zigzag syntax instead.

Note that the actions `RUN_SCRIPT` (`goto script $string`) and `LOAD_MAP` (`load map $string`) will cause the current script slot to jump to an entirely different script. In such cases, any in-progress zigzags will be aborted.

#### Consequences and drawbacks

1. This macro does not understand MGS Natlang syntax at all, and simply moves tokens around into an expanded form somewhat naively. What's more is that this macro does not create procedural scripts intelligently; it will make entirely empty scripts in certain conditions, e.g. when there's no converging behavior after a zigzag.
	- **This is currently a big problem for `on_tick` scripts**, as the game will crash if an empty `on_tick` script is attempted. Several kinds of common `on_tick` behavior will therefore need to be done the old way.
2. This abstracted syntax obscures the fact that script jumps are happening.
	- If you `COPY_SCRIPT` a script containing any zigzag syntax, only actions from the first script chunk will actually be copied.
	- For `on_interact` scripts that must always start from the top on each attempt and for `on_tick` scripts that must loop indefinitely, you will need to **reset** the script as the very last action if there is any zigzagging involved.
3. Any script behavior that needs to be referenced by an external script cannot be made into a zigzag, as the external script needs a script name to reference.

#### Syntax

Zigzags always consist of an `if` statement, at bare minimum:

- `if ( <CONDITION> ) { <BEHAVIOR> }`

```
scriptName {
  behavior-1
  if ( condition-A ) {
    behavior-A
  }
  behavior-2
}
```

- The `if` **condition** is wrapped with parentheses, and the `if` **body** is wrapped with curly braces.
- The `if` body can contain script actions or additional zigzags.
- Normal actions can occur before and after the `if`.
- Actions that occur after the zigzag will happen regardless of whether the `if` condition is met.

`if` statements can be followed by `else if` and `else` in the standard manner, wherein the script logic will take one of many mutually-exclusive paths.

- `else if ( <CONDITION> ) { <BEHAVIOR> }`
- `else { <BEHAVIOR> }`

```
scriptName {
  behavior-1
  if ( condition-A ) {
    behavior-A
  } else if ( condition-B ) {
    behavior-B
  } else if ( condition-C ) {
    behavior-C
  } else {
    behavior-X
  }
  behavior-2
}
```

- If an `if` or `else if` condition is met, no other conditions from that zigzag chain is checked.
- `else` results in behavior that happens if none of the above `if` or `else if` conditions are met.
- Any number of `else if`s is allowed, but only one `else` is allowed.
- Shared behavior will resume after an `else` statement or after the last `else if` statement.

Remember: An `if` and `else if` is *not* equivalent to two `if`s!

#### Compound conditions

Multiple conditions can be checked at the same time with `||` (boolean OR), which indicates that *any* of the given conditions can be true for the branching behavior to occur:

```
scriptName {
  if ( condition-A || condition-B ) {
    behavior-AB
  }
}
```

The equivalent boolean AND (`&&`) is not implemented, however. If you need an AND, you will need to invert the conditions and use OR:

```
// NOT ALLOWED:

if ( you have money && the game is for sale ) {
  buy the game
} else {
  don't buy the game
}

// INSTEAD:

if ( you don't have money || the game is not for sale ) {
  don't buy the game
} else {
  buy the game
}
```

### `const!`

This macro emulates compile-time constants. Its main purpose is to help you avoid "magic numbers" in your scripts by allowing you to define a [number](#number) or [string](#string) (or whatever) in a single place, even if you need to use it multiple times.

The macro literally replaces each const with the token collected during its original value assignment.

These consts are *not* meant to be used as variables for in-game logic, as the game will never see the const as a variable at all, but will only see the token captured by the macro during the const's value assignment. To emphasize this point, you cannot change the value of a const once you've defined it. If you find yourself wanting to do this, you probably want to be using a MGE variable instead.

For value assignment:

```
const! ()
```

Inside the above parentheses can be any number of constant assignments:

```
<CONST_NAME> = <VALUE>
```

- `CONST_NAME`: `$` + [bareword](#bareword) (e.g. `$varName`)
- `VALUE`: any MGS Natlang variable whatsoever, e.g. any [number](#number), [string](#string), [bareword](#bareword), [duration](#duration), etc.

Keep in mind that `$` is used for [MGS Natlang variables](#mgs-natlang-variables) in his document's example syntax, but that is a different usage, as those variables are to be replaced by values of that variable type, whereas these constants will appear in the final MGS file literally in the form `$_`.

#### Example

```
const! (
  $field = x
  $bigNumber = 9001
  $hamburgers = "Steamed Toast"
)

testScript {
  set entity $hamburgers $field to $bigNumber
}
```

After the macro does its work, the script `testScript` instead will read:

```
testScript {
  set entity "Steamed Toast" x to 9001
}
```

The above is what the MGS Natlang syntax parser will actually parse. Syntax errors (if any) will be caught at that point and not before; the macro literally doesn't care what the underlying syntax is.

#### Limitations

`const!` registers and replaces tokens; it does not find-and-replace arbitrary strings. For this reason, you will not be able to use consts inside a [quoted string](#quoted-string), since a quoted string *in its entirety* counts as a single token.

## Action dictionary

These dictionary entries use the default JSON action parameter names, e.g. `entity` for an entity's name (syntax: `entity $entity:string`).

Some of these patterns may also have some hidden parameters built in to the phrasing, such as "is" and "is not" incorporating the JSON action parameter `expected_bool`. These will be noted when they occur.

As a reminder, words in parentheses are optional. For example, the dictionary pattern:

```
set entity $entity:string tick_script (to) $string:string 
```

will be satisfied by either of the following:

```
set entity "Entity Name" tick_script to scriptName
set entity "Entity Name" tick_script scriptName
```
