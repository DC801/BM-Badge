	- [x] byte to encode position (i.e. is the text on the top or bottom of the screen, is the portrait on the left or right side of the screen, should we display a portrait at all?, etc.).
		- [x] flags for position encoding byte:
			- [x] Top or Bottom
			- [x] Portrait on or off
			- [x] portrait left or right
	- [x] Portraits
		- [x] Encoder
			- [x] Needs new top-level protrait type
			- [x] Needs to store portrait on entityType
			- [x] Dialog
				- [x] Needs to store portrait not associated with entityType on dialog
				- [x] Manually specifyable even if not associated with any entity
				- [x] Needs to store flip_x
		- [x] Engine
			- [x] Should match current entityType of speaking entities
			- [x] Support Entity Hacked state
			- [x] look at dialog alignment, and if it's "RIGHT", toggle flip_x into the flags byte
	- [x] tilesetId and tileId for the portrait picture.
	- [x] Support for string templates that make use of hacked entity names
	- [x] Support for string templates that make use of numeric variables
	- [x] Please stop player walking when a dialog shows

- [x] Fix name not sticking to player when changing rooms
- [x] Look into why EtherNettles puzzle is not triggering
	- [x] it's probably a modulo issue on tileId and tilesetId
- [x] Make a new dialog tileset that is mostly transparent for the main menu
- [x] Make some background artwork for the main menu
- [ ] Create action for setBackground
- [x] Fix portrait from last conversation being used on dialogScreens that have none
- [x] Remove AnimationFrames to free enough ram to run on Hardware again
- [x] Fix Color palette corruption bug
	- [x] Add corruption detection and logging
	- [x] Now just reproduce it again - what could possibly have been causing this?
		- [x] Turns out it was something indexing into `entities[255]` and mutating that entity - but entities were only allocated to 64. Entities were allocated just before the ColorPalettes.

## Playtesting night notes:
- [x] Text changes: "No! Not Tuesday, T.U.E.S.D.A.Y.!"
- [x] People hit escape to close the hex editor, and it closes the program. Oops. Default it to Alt+F4.
- [ ] An idea: I didn't see anyone saving after completing puzzles. Perhaps after each puzzle is solved, show the save dialog, so nobody loses any progress. Perhaps show this after the TUESDAY cutscene as well.
- [x] We really need to rearrange the Elder's speeches "I'm X, and I do Y" so that it is outside of the lodge. Nobody talked with them out side of the lodge without direction.
- [x] People talk to a lot of objects in the greenhouse, but don't get interactions. Add more interactions there.
- [x] People talked to the quest board, and it said nothing. Oops. Add some dialog.
- [x] There is still a debug exa in the beatrice puzzle room. Oops.
- [ ] After switching delmar from to sheep to man, you can't talk with him. Player expected to talk with him.
- [x] Fix a bug where modulo on the animation always picks (whatever, mage walking north, blitzball) when the currentAnimation is cycled - it glitches across palettes.
	- [x] This is not actually a bug, because the byte changing was primaryIdType. This is expected behavior.
- [?] When you load from the main menu on desktop before you've created a save, it crashes.
- [x] NewGnu tried to set the corrupted byte on the Big Bad Name Book to uncorrupt the name. He was really fixated on learning about that.
	- [x] We should make it do a rot 13 of RED HERRING
- [x] Add Desvio to special thanks
- [x] Add AdwareHunter to special thanks
- [x] Add a book that mentions that you can press XOR and MEM3 to reset the map.
- [ ] Rax asks: Is there a place to snag a copy of the books outside of the game, other than to go parse the source code?
	- [ ] Me: Oh man. Not a bad idea! Perhaps we could release a little "Game Manual" with those! Perhaps a print out that's empty, and they player can fill in the values.
- [x] NewGnu found that if you set the onTick index to the save action, you can write every tick. FRY ROM STORAGE REAL QUICK
	- [x] Solution? Show a "Save completed" dialog after save completes, because then it can only burn through as fast as they can confirm the "Save completed" dialog.
- [ ] Desvio says that Bert should say something different if his name is changed to "Bart" or "Bort" - reference to Simpsons "Who would name a kid Bort" sketch
- [x] If player moves the flowers, Trekkie should yell at the player for uprooting the flowers, and then reset the position of all flowers.
- [x] Talking with the modem should cause the mage to say "Yup, looks like it's not connecting." or "Yay, it's connecting now!"
- [x] When loading a new map, put the hex cursor back at the player
- [x] There is a table tile that is on layer 3 in the inner sanctum, but the rest of them are below?
- [!] Possibly redesign the layout of the sheep quest so that the pen is not obscured by the old lady's house.
- [x] NewGnu tried to glitch the pipscat so it was in the where the cat construction crew was. Very reasonable. Should this be an alternate solution?
	- [x] I think that this should be countered with "When the cat is glitched off their stump, he should automatically walk back to the point where he started."
- [x] During CorfidBizna's playthrough, she triggered a "fade to black" script, and reloading the map didn't make things playable again.
	- [x] To fix, LoadMap should set fadeFraction to 0
- [x] Fix the ???Mystery Sink??? in the player's house?!?
- [x] Each of the members of the cat construction crew should say something different to the player when they are the PipsCat
- [x] The path leading north of the Library should take the player to an "UNDER CONSTRUCTION" zone, saying something about how it's not ready yet.
- [ ] The wrap-around at the bottom of the map should fade out and then in again
- [x] Re-do the handling of the right side buttons when in the HexEditor
	- [x] Create Clipboard system
		- [x] Create a buffer that is sizeof(MageEntity)
		- [x] A value to indicate the length of what's on the clipboard
		- [x] Display current clipboard value in header or footer, truncated to 4 bytes and '...'
		- [x] Copy method
		- [x] Paste method
			- [x] When your paste changes the entityType AND position, it doesn't move to the pasted location for the first tick because the "Did the tile size change this tick" entity jump protection kicks in
		- [x] Store the clipboard value + length into save file as well
	- [x] △ should increment the current byte's value by 1
	- [x] ◯ should copy the current byte's value into the copy buffer
		- [x] while holding ◯, moving the left/right arrows will select additional cells
	- [x] ✕ should decrement the current byte's value by 1
	- [x] ◻ should paste the copy buffer into the current byte's value
	- [x] The value +/- operations should be slowed down
	- [x] The "triangle to open on an entity + cooldown before normal hex operation" should actually restore normal hex control via "on release handler"
- [x] Add an action to enable/disable copy & paste. It's too powerful to start the game with; Perhaps it is granted by an artifact from a dungeon in 2021?
- [ ] Re-do the handling of the MEM buttons in the HexEditor
	- [x] Make the addresses stored relative to the currently selected entity
	- [x] How to set relative MEM addresses?
		- [x] Hold PAGE and press MEM* to set
		- [ ] Long-Hold MEM* to set?
	- [x] Press MEM* to move cursor there, both in and out of the editor
	- [x] Store your 4 MEM addresses into the save file as uint8_t, because MEMs are now relative
- [x] Prepare scenario data for bootloader's USB-C/magic drive update flavor
	- [x] `game.dat` gets a new header:
		- [x] `MAGEGAME`
		- [x] uint32_t CRC32 of the `game.dat` before the CRC32 is added
		- [x] uint32_t length of `game.dat`
	- [x] `save_[0,1,2].dat` gets a new header:
		- [x] `MAGESAVE`
		- [x] uint32_t CRC32 from `game.dat` (so we know if versions match)
		- [x] uint32_t length of the `save_[0,1,2].dat`
- [x] Improve the "Power on" experience of the hardware
	- [x] ROM _is_ valid,
		- [x] and SD _is not_ present, start game
		- [x] and SD _is_ present, hash is same, start game
		- [x] and SD _is_ present, hash is diff, show options
		- [x] and SD _is_ present, MEM3 is held, show options
	- [x] ROM _is not_ valid,
		- [x] and SD _is not_ present, engine panic with message about no rom
		- [x] and SD _is_ present, _do not_ show options and just copy
	- [x] Desktop build should also ENGINE_PANIC if ROM Magic is bad
- [ ] Entity "Action" animation continues playing during dialog but only sometimes
- [ ] Entities go to space when the duration of a walk path is less than the milliseconds per frame of the current fps
- [x] Hamster has a bug report. The save icon's background dialog tileset is missing.
- [x] Use entity property `is_debug` (true) to make certain entities "Debug mode only"
	- [x] Set the "Warp Fish" `is_debug` true
	- [x] Set the Exa `entity_type` property `is_debug` true by default
	- [x] Add kaitai `render_flags` type to entity instance direction help show what's up
	- [x] Make encoder set the `0b0100000` renderFlags so those entities can be filtered out at runtime
	- [x] In engine, implement runtime "show debug entities" mode
		- [x] Add `is_debug` for `0b0100000` bit on renderFlags
		- [x] Pick a key combination to toggle this mode
			- [x] Pressing the key combination reloads the current map and disables the filter
		- [x] Filter the entities by the `0b0100000` renderFlags, while tracking the original + filtered entityId
			- [x] Make an array that maps `mapLocalEntityId` to `filteredMapLocalEntityId`
			- [x] Change the getEntity* methods to use this
		- [x] Diligence:
			- [x] Review all usages of `MAX_ENTITIES_PER_MAP`
			- [x] Review all usages of `map.EntityCount()`
			- [x] Review all usages of `entities[`
			- [x] Review all usages of `entityRenderableData[` -> `getEntityRenderableDataByMapLocalId`

			- [x] Review all usages of `mapLocalEntityIds`
			- [x] Review all usages of `playerEntityIndex`
			- [x] Review all usages of `cameraFollowEntityId`
			- [x] Make sure that entity hacking still doesn't jank the player
			- [x] Make sure that camera wiggle functions still work
			- [x] Test it on the hardware
- [x] Make a "Warp Zone" map that can take players to all of the debug maps
	- [x] Make the "Warp Fish" send the player the "Warp Zone"
	- [x] Add the "Warp Fish" fish to all the debug maps
- [x] Fix bug where loading an un-initialized save doesn't start with default values
- [x] In the Dialog, when there are choices, the cursor will loop to the top when you press the down arrow, but not when pressing up from the top item, but it should
- [x] Purge all the actions that didn't get implemented
	- [x] PAUSE_GAME
	- [x] PAUSE_ENTITY_SCRIPT

	- [ ] `SET_MAP_LOOK` (script_name)
	- [ ] `SET_ITEM_LOOK` (item_name, script_name)
	- [ ] `SET_ENTITY_LOOK` (entity_name, script_name)
	- [ ] `SET_ITEM_USE` (item_name, script_name)
	- [ ] `CHECK_MAP` (map_name, expected_state, success_script)
	- [ ] `CHECK_BLE_FLAG` (flag_constant_name, expected_state, success_script)
	- [ ] `SET_BLE_FLAG` (flag_constant_name, bool_value)
- [ ] Add numeric "constants" support to encoder
- [ ] Serial Dungeon
	- [ ] Create a new `maps.json`; Maps are named keys full of objects:
		- [x] `path` example "maps/map-main_menu.json"
		- [x] `on_tick` script
		- [x] `on_load` script
		- [x] `on_look` script
		- [ ] `items` is an array of strings that map to global item names
		- [x] `directions` is an object of `"direction_name": "script_name"`, so `go $DIRECTION` calls a script
			- JSON looks like:
				```
				directions: {
					north: 'go_main_hall_north',
					east: 'go_torii_gate',
					south: 'go_goat_room',
					west: 'go_west_room',
				}
				```
	- [x] Map struct changes
		- [x] `on_look` script
		- [x] `script_padding` 2 bytes
			- [x] Change the encoder to handle this new shape
			- [x] Update the kaitai struct
			- [x] Update the C
		- [x] `direction_count` uint8_t
		- [x] `directions` is an array, so `go $DIRECTION` calls a script
			- [x] `name` 12 bytes script ids,
			- [x] `script_id` 2 bytes
			- [x] `padding` 2 bytes to get us back into 16 alignment
	- [ ] Entity struct changes
		- [ ] `on_look` script, stored in bytes 30 & 31
	- [ ] Action `setEntityScript` needs some TLC and testing for setting look scripts
	- [ ] New Item struct - managed in `items.json`
		- [ ] There may not be more than 64 items in the whole universe
		- [ ] 16 of these items need to be held in ram because the scripts need to be mutable to allow branching
		- [ ] When you load map, loop through the `ItemLocationArray` and load items in the room, or in player inventory, into 1 of 16 slots in ram
		- [ ] Struct details
			- [ ] `name` 12 chars
			- [ ] `on_look` script
			- [ ] `on_use` script
	- [ ] New ItemLocationArray
		- [ ] Part of the save struct
		- [ ] It's an array of 64 long, matching the `items` limit
		- [ ] 2 bytes per item `current_location` value
			- [ ] 0x0000 means nowhere
			- [ ] 0x0001 0xFFFE means it's on a map
			- [ ] 0xFFFF means it's in the player's inventory
	- [ ] Web build should get a toggleable "console" area below the gameplay window, that basically looks like the `text_based_adventure_prototype`
	- [ ] Text based adventure
		- [ ] Player loses control over the joysticks and things are instead done over the serial CLI
		- [ ] Serial command processing system
			- [ ] Complete list of possible command formats
				- [ ] Verb: 'look', 'inventory' 'help'
				- [ ] Verb, Target: 'look flask', 'get flask', 'go north'
			- [ ] Verbs to implement
				- [ ] help - shows a list of available commands and their syntax
				- [ ] look - Without an argument, runs the current room's `on_look` script, or a fallback to "There is nothing here but sadness". If there is an argument, looks to the items in that room, and then the inventory to try and find an item with a matching name.
					- [x] Implement execution of `on_look` script
					- [x] Implement listing of available directions
					- [ ] Implement listing of items on map/in room
					- [ ] Implement running `on_look` for items
					- [ ] Implement running `on_look` for entities
				- [x] go - Looks up the `directions` in the current room, and if there is one that matches the second argument, runs the script for going that direction
				- [ ] get/take
				- [ ] drop/yeet
				- [ ] inventory - Shows the names of current inventory items
				- [ ] use - runs the item's `on_use` script from any item in the current room, or your inventory
				- [ ] teleport - allows you to teleport to any room that you know the name of. This functions as a "fast travel" after you have built the server. Becomes enabled via a specific flag like the Hex Editor.
		- [ ] The tileset actually just looks like a Zelda MiniMap
			- [ ] https://nucloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/zelda-dungeon-maps.png
		- [ ] This dungeon can has an inventory system
		- [ ] What powers do the Serial artifact give you?
			- [ ] Having an inventory at all
			- [ ] Teleport - if you know the name of a room anywhere in the game, you can type `warp $ROOM_NAME`
		- [ ] The end goal of the Serial Dungeon + having inventory
		- [ ] We need an interactive character named PuTTY
			- [ ] It should be illustrated or described as a Morph suit like the PUTTYs from Power Rangers
	- [ ] You need to be able to build a ~~PC~~ Server from multiple components found in the Serial Dungeon
		- [ ] In the story, you need to build a server so that you can access/use the serial commands outside of the serial dungeon, and progress in the game by finding secret parts of rooms you've already been in with the `look` command.
		- [ ] You need a Case
		- [ ] You need a Motherboard
		- [ ] You need a Power Supply
		- [ ] You need a CPU
		- [ ] You need RAM
		- [ ] You need a Keyboard - but you can only find a Keytar, or a midi-enabled Button Accordion with a midi to USB keyboard adapter
		- [ ] There's a cat, and you need to convince it to give you its mouse
		- [ ] There's a Bitcoin Mine, and you need to convince them to stop burning down the planet and free the video cards
		- [ ] When you have all of the components are ready, the EXA says: `Now all we need is a Banana, and some Hope!`
			- [ ] Procure Banana
			- [ ] Procure Hope
			- [ ] In the end, the `hope` doesn't help, and you must resort to `percussive maintenance` to get the server to turn on
- [ ] Filesystem Dungeon
	- [ ] Figure out how to create a USB Mass Storage disk from of the contents of like 4KB of RAM.
		- [ ] Use a super tiny block size.
	- [ ] Serial command `mount` will cause Mass Storage device to mount
	- [ ] Serial command `open` will uhh... invoke a file on the virtual FS
		- [ ] Somewhere there should be a `sesame.sh`, and `open sesame.sh` should solve that puzzle
	- [ ] A chmod/chown puzzle.
		- [ ] Enemy dies. drops weapon on to the FileSystem.
		- [ ] Player can't pick up weapon because its permissions are wrong.
		- [ ] Chmod/chown that file/weapon. Now player can pick it up, enemy can't.
- [ ] Uhhh more Hex Dungeon
	- [ ] Change the layout of the dungeon from spelling `FF` to `0x` because that's more awesome.
	- [ ] Perhaps unlock/add more in-game memory than just the entity structs for the HexEditor?
- [ ] When the player approaches a puzzle that they have not seen before, we should blink the light on the board that corresponds to the interface used to solve that puzzle

### Story ideas
- [ ] After you have all of the artifacts, someone/something should steal them.
	- [ ] Hacking the save file to restore your artifacts
- [ ] When you are directed to go get the 3 artifacts, it is super easy to go get them.
	- [ ] Then when you give them to SPOILERS, everything goes terrible.
	- [ ] They are teleported back into the dungeons, but much deeper, and you have to go the long way to get them back

### Puzzle ideas
- [ ] There's an exit somewhere in a forest that you can't get to any way other than being in that room, but using serial to `go $SECRET_ROOM_NAME` when you're in there
- [ ] There's a sleeping Snorlax blocking your path in one of the forests.
	- [ ] You need the inventory system so that you can cary an otamatone to play music and wake him up.
- [ ] A floor might be on fire. The player has to turn off the "firewall" to cross that part.
- [ ] Liar'sville puzzle. Start unsolveable. Two black-hats
	- [ ] Must change one of the color of one of their hats so at least one tells truth
- [ ] You need to read a value from Bluetooth to open a certain door?
