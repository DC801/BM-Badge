	- [x] Binary Encoder parts
	- [x] Scripts
		- [x] What is a script?
			- [x] It's a length + sequence of Actions
			- [x] Scripts shouldn't be able to be called when the player has opened the hex editor, but scripts should be able to open the hex editor when called from elsewhere.
			- [x] We'll need entity-based state variables to track pathing and other transient values between ticks.
		- [x] Map
			- [x] onMapLoad(uint16_t scriptId); //called once when the map loads
			- [x] onMapTick(uint16_t scriptId); //called every tick, used for doors, other static events when moving around map.
		- [x] Entity
			- [x] onEntityTick(uint16_t scriptId, uint8_t entityId); //called every tick, entityId is the entity calling that script.

	- [x] byte to encode position (i.e. is the text on the top or bottom of the screen, is the portrait on the left or right side of the screen, should we display a portrait at all?, etc.).
		- [x] flags for position encoding byte:
			- [x] Top or Bottom
			- [x] Portrait on or off
			- [x] portrait left or right
	- [x] Portraits
		- [x] Encoder
			- [x] Needs new top-level protrait type
			- [x] Needs to store portrait on entityType
			- [x] Dialog
				- [x] Needs to store portrait not associated with entityType on dialog
				- [x] Manually specifyable even if not associated with any entity
				- [x] Needs to store flip_x
		- [x] Engine
			- [x] Should match current entityType of speaking entities

			- [x] look at dialog alignment, and if it's "RIGHT", toggle flip_x into the flags byte
	- [ ] Fix name not sticking to player when changing rooms

	- [ ] Now just reproduce it again - what could possibly have been causing this?

## Playtesting night notes:
- [ ] Text changes: "No! Not Tuesday, T.U.E.S.D.A.Y.!"
- [ ] People hit escape to close the hex editor, and it closes the program. Oops. Default it to something else.
- [ ] An idea: I didn't see anyone saving after completing puzzles. Perhaps after each puzzle is solved, show the save dialog, so nobody loses any progress. Perhaps show this after the TUESDAY cutscene as well.
- [x] We really need to rearrange the Elder's speeches "I'm X, and I do Y" so that it is outside of the lodge. Nobody talked with them out side of the lodge without direction.
- [x] People talk to a lot of objects in the greenhouse, but don't get interactions. Add more interactions there.
- [x] People talked to the quest board, and it said nothing. Oops. Add some dialog.
- [x] There is still a debug exa in the beatrice puzzle room. Oops.
- [ ] After switching delmar from to sheep to man, you can't talk with him. Player expected to talk with him.
- [ ] Fix a bug where modulo on the animation always picks (whatever, mage walking north, blitzball) when the currentAnimation is cycled - it glitches across palettes.
- [ ] When you load from the main menu on desktop before you've created a save, it crashes.
- [ ] NewGnu tried to set the corrupted byte on the Big Bad Name Book to uncorrupt the name. He was really fixated on learning about that.
	- [ ] We should make it do a rot 13 of RED HERRING
- [x] Add Desvio to special thanks
- [x] Add AdwareHunter to special thanks
- [ ] Add a book that mentions that you can press XOR and MEM0 to reset the map.
- [ ] Rax asks: Is there a place to snag a copy of the books outside of the game, other than to go parse the source code?
- [ ] Me: Oh man. Not a bad idea! Perhaps we could release a little "Game Manual" with those! Perhaps a print out that's empty, and they player can fill in the values.
- [ ] NewGnu found that if you set the onInteract to the save action, you ca write every tick. FRY ROM STORAGE REAL QUICK
	- [ ] Solution? Show a "Save completed" dialog after save completes, because then it can only burn through as fast as they can confirm the "Save completed" dialog.
- [ ] Desvio says that Bert should say something different if his name is changed to "Bart" or "Bort" - reference to Simpsons "Who would name a kid Bort" sketch
- [ ] If player moves the flowers, Trekkie should yell at the player for uprooting the flowers, and then reset the position of all flowers.
- [ ] Talking with the modem should cause the mage to say "Yup, looks like it's not connecting." or "Yay, it's connecting now!"
- [ ] When loading a new map, put the hex cursor back at the player
- [x] There is a table tile that is on layer 3 in the inner sanctum, but the rest of them are below?
- [ ] Possibly redesign the layout of the sheep quest so that the pen is not obscured by the old lady's house.
- [x] NewGnu tried to glitch the pipscat so it was in the where the cat construction crew was. Very reasonable. Should this be an alternate solution?
	- [x] I think that this should be countered with "When the cat is glitched off their stump, he should automatically walk back to the point where he started."

## Encoder TODO:
- [x] Throw error when > 1 entities have `is_player`
- [ ] Build a test map with no entities and make sure it does not crash
- [x] Fix bug where empty string for script on map or entity does not encode as null_script
- [ ] Action Argument Getters:
	- [ ] color
	- [ ] button_id (need enum lookup)
	- [ ] entity hex cells
	- [ ] sound id lookup for scripts and dialogs
- [ ] Music/SFX encoding in the binary asset encoder
- [ ] Consider adding lookup encoding for setting primary ID, secondary ID, and primary ID type. The numbers seem to be unreliable when you change things in a map (i.e. a mage entity primary id is 3, then after changing something unrelated and re-encoding it jumped to 13), so being able to do a lookup to make sure an entity gets their type set to a specific thing would be useful.

## Hardware TODO:

- [x] Get keyboard chip working and reliably updating button states
- [x] Get LED control chip working and update LED control functions
- [x] Update FrameBuffer.h to work with the new larger screen
- [x] Use SD card for testing game until ROM chip is functional
- [ ] Get ROM chip read/write working reliably
- [ ] Verify function of all desktop testing build features are working correctly on badge hardware
- [ ] Fix audio driver and initialize communication with audio chip
