- [ ] Script system
	- [x] Binary Encoder parts
	- [x] Scripts
		- [x] What is a script?
			- [x] It's a length + sequence of Actions
			- [x] Scripts shouldn't be able to be called when the player has opened the hex editor, but scripts should be able to open the hex editor when called from elsewhere.
			- [x] We'll need entity-based state variables to track pathing and other transient values between ticks.
		- [x] Map
			- [x] onMapLoad(uint16_t scriptId); //called once when the map loads
			- [x] onMapTick(uint16_t scriptId); //called every tick, used for doors, other static events when moving around map.
		- [x] Entity
			- [x] onEntityTick(uint16_t scriptId, uint8_t entityId); //called every tick, entityId is the entity calling that script.
			- [x] onEntityInteract(uint16_t scriptId); //called when the player interacts with the entity

	- [x] polyline(uint8_t count, x points[count])
	- [x] point(uint16_t x, uint16_t y)
	- [x] Geometry::inside_poly(point) collision detection function
	- [x] draw() renders geometry to screen
- [ ] Collision System
	- [ ] For Tiles
	- [ ] For Entities
- [ ] Dialog Data Type Implementation:
	- [ ] Display Name - either stringId, or entityId
	- [x] The actual text to display, probably with line breaks hard coded in to keep things simple.
	- [x] byte to encode position (i.e. is the text on the top or bottom of the screen, is the portrait on the left or right side of the screen, should we display a portrait at all?, etc.).
		- [x] flags for position encoding byte:
			- [x] Top or Bottom
			- [x] Portrait on or off
			- [x] portrait left or right
	- [x] tilesetId and tileId for the portrait picture.
	- [ ] display font
	- [ ] voice sound Id
	- [ ] Dialog Responses:
		- [ ] response TypeId:
			- [ ] NO_RESPONSE = 0
			- [ ] SELECT_FROM_SHORT_LIST = 1
			- [ ] SELECT_FROM_LONG_LIST = 2
			- [ ] ENTER_NUMBER = 2
			- [ ] ENTER_ALPHANUMERIC = 3
			- [ ] etc...
		- [ ] Player responses to dialog may be desired:
			- [ ] Assuming pop-up happens while dialog is still active:
				- [ ] select from a list of options
				- [ ] enter a numerical code
				- [ ] enter an alphanumeric code (put on-screen keyboard over dialog? Cycle through all letter options like arcade name entry?)
			- [ ] new script and/or dialog to call depending on player response
		- [ ] Show bouncing arrow at bottom of dialog to indicate that the player should press button to continue
- [x] Strings
	- [x] uint16_t Length
	- [x] char array with null termination Length bytes long
- [ ] Save system with flags
	- [ ] Player Name (12 bytes, like all other entities)
	- [ ] On map init, replace player name into PlayerEntity
	- [ ] Use bit flags in a specific region of the ROM chip to encode SAVE data automatically as events transpire.

## Encoder TODO:
- [x] Throw error when > 1 entities have `is_player`
- [ ] Build a test map with no entities and make sure it does not crash
- [x] Fix bug where empty string for script on map or entity does not encode as null_script
- [ ] Action Argument Getters:
	- [ ] color
	- [ ] button_id (need enum lookup)
	- [ ] entity hex cells
	- [ ] sound id lookup for scripts and dialogs
- [ ] Music/SFX encoding in the binary asset encoder
- [ ] Consider adding lookup encoding for setting primary ID, secondary ID, and primary ID type. The numbers seem to be unreliable when you change things in a map (i.e. a mage entity primary id is 3, then after changing something unrelated and re-encoding it jumped to 13), so being able to do a lookup to make sure an entity gets their type set to a specific thing would be useful.

## Hardware TODO:

- [x] Get keyboard chip working and reliably updating button states
- [x] Get LED control chip working and update LED control functions
- [x] Update FrameBuffer.h to work with the new larger screen
- [x] Use SD card for testing game until ROM chip is functional
- [ ] Get ROM chip read/write working reliably
- [ ] Verify function of all desktop testing build features are working correctly on badge hardware
- [ ] Fix audio driver and initialize communication with audio chip
